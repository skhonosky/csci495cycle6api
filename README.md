a. Description / Purpose - I created a WebAPI in C# that focuses on retreiving the desired information from an external database based on REST commands such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

b. Dependencies - Postman (aids with Get, Post, Put, and Delete) VSCode (used to build the application) MySQL (used to build and interact with database)

c. Usage - This program can be used to gather, update, add, and/or delete information from an external database.

d. Future Work - In the future, I plan on adding more functions into the website to gather more specific information.

e. What is your major and how this project is related to your major. - I am double majoring in Nursing and Information Systems, and this project is related to my major because it focuses on working with databases and this will aid when having to interact with databases in a hospital setting as everything for patients is logged in one.
